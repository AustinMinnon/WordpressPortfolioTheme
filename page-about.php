                    Well hello, and thanks for visiting!<br/><br/> My name is Austin, I am a certified website and mobile application developer, and student of life-long progression.

                <h3>Technical Vocation School</h3>
                <p>
                    Focused on serving those who don't have easy access to learning technology, Epicodus is a vocational school for aspiring programmers located in Portland, Oregon. I was drawn so far away from home to Epicodus for their rigorous curriculum, diverse community, great value, and specifically the JavaScript/Java/Android development courses where I could learn about Android Studio, as well as web based applications using Java. These courses all paired together offered an experience that cracked the world of development wide open for me.

                <h3>Welcome to Portland</h3>
                <p>
                    Upon acceptance by Epicodus, a close friend and I drove from nearly Portland, Maine to just outside of Portland, Oregon. Learning the basics of programming was overwhelming at first in the introduction course. However in only a few weeks, the command line felt like home, and JavaScript loops were like clockwork.

                <h3>Weekly Workflow</h3>
                <p>
                    Four days per week, we would be prompted to find a partner and work with them for the day pair programming. The expectations were laid out during the previous night's homework, and we would work throughout the day to apply those concepts.

                <p>
                    Every Friday a code challenge project would be presented covering the week's work. Although some requirements were foreseeable, it felt like a test to me. I HATE TESTS. Code review challenges were presented on many occasions, but were usually just one extra piece of functionality to the week's objective.
                </p>
                <p>
                     One time I coded my heart out to complete a project in the allotted time of 8 hours, and I had a bug in my code. I remember getting home after class and rushing to my PC to debug a JavaScript function that I couldn't figure out. After testing more I had realized the minute detail, and that was the most satisfying bug fix to me at the time.

                <h3>Virtual Reality Internship</h3>
                <p>Fast forward 4 months. Upon completion of Epicodus' Web and Mobile Development curriculum, I opted into the Epicodus internship program featuring local tech companies and startups. My first set of technical interviews EVER had manifested into an intern position with VR Northwest, a pioneer in 360 video production, and real world virtual reality tours

                <h3>The Future is Now</h3>
                <p>Since completing Epicodus and finishing my internship, I have relocated to Maine where I am seeking new opportunities in web development. Job searching has not been lucrative. In spite of that, I have been learning WordPress theme creation, and have hosted this website that you are viewing. My latest aspirations have been focusing on how to help small businesses, and how they might benefit from a content management system like WordPress. More to come on that topic soon!
